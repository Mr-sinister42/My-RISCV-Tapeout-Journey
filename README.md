# My Digital Logbook: RISC-V SoC Design Tapeout

Welcome to my project repository for the VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program. This space serves as my personal logbook, chronicling the entire journey from foundational concepts to the final tapeout of a System-on-Chip.

The core mission of this program is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by building a complete SoC using open-source EDA tools. This repository will track my progress, challenges, and key takeaways on a weekly basis.

### Project Milestone Tracker

| Week | Focus Area | Status & Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | **The Digital Workbench:** Environment and EDA Toolchain Setup. | ✅ **Complete** - [View Details](./Week0/Task0/README.md) |
| **1** | *Awaiting Assignment...* | ⏳ **Pending** |

### Foundational Skills Acquired (Week 0)

* Mastered the setup of a virtualized Linux environment (Ubuntu) tailored for VLSI development.
* Successfully installed and validated a suite of critical open-source EDA tools, establishing a complete RTL-to-GDSII workflow.
* Gained practical experience with the command-line operations essential for simulation, synthesis, and physical design.

### Acknowledgment & Gratitude

I am profoundly grateful to **Kunal Ghosh** and the **VLSI System Design (VSD)** organization for spearheading this transformative educational initiative. My participation is also made possible by the vital contributions of **RISC-V International**, the **India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)**, the **VLSI Society of India (VSI)**, and **Efabless**.
