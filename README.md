# RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my progress and learnings through the comprehensive RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program, organized by VLSI System Design (VSD).

This program offers a complete hands-on experience in designing a System-on-Chip (SoC), from writing RTL in Verilog to generating the final GDSII layout file using open-source EDA tools. It is a cornerstone of India's mission to build a robust semiconductor ecosystem, enabling thousands of engineers to gain practical, silicon-level design skills.

### Weekly Progress Log

| Week | Task Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Week 0* | üõ† *Environment and EDA Tool Setup* ‚Äî Installed and verified Yosys, Iverilog, GTKWave, Magic, and Ngspice. | ‚úÖ Complete |
| *Week 1* | Upcoming... | ‚è≥ Pending |

### üåü Key Learnings from Week 0

* Successfully configured a virtual environment on Ubuntu for VLSI design work.
* Installed a full suite of open-source EDA tools required for the RTL-to-GDSII flow.
* Gained foundational knowledge of the commands and workflows for synthesis, simulation, and layout tools.

### üôè Acknowledgments

I extend my sincere gratitude to *Kunal Ghosh* and the entire *VLSI System Design (VSD)* team for this incredible learning opportunity.

This initiative would not be possible without the foundational support of *RISC-V International, the **India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), the **VLSI Society of India (VSI), and **Efabless*.
