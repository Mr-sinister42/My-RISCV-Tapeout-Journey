# ðŸš€ Week 0 Report: Building the Digital Workbench

The inaugural week was focused on a critical first step: constructing a robust and reliable development environment. This involved provisioning a virtual machine and installing the core open-source toolchain required for digital VLSI design.

### Virtual Machine Specifications

An isolated Ubuntu environment was configured within VirtualBox to ensure stability and portability. The allocated resources are documented below.

| Parameter | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guest OS** | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS |
| **System Memory (RAM)** | 8 GB |
| **Processor Cores** | 4 vCPUs |
| **Storage (Virtual Disk)** | 50 GB (Dynamically Allocated) |

### EDA Toolchain Installation Log

The following section details the installation and verification of the essential components for our RTL design workflow.

#### 1. Yosys - Synthesis Engine

* **Function:** Yosys is the core synthesis tool that translates abstract Verilog RTL code into a concrete, optimized gate-level netlist.
* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git build-essential clang bison flex libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 zlib1g-dev

    # Compile from source
    cd $HOME && git clone [https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git) && cd yosys
    make config-gcc && make && sudo make install
    ```
* **Verification Snapshot:**
    `yosys --version`
    

#### 2. Icarus Verilog - RTL Simulator

* **Function:** A trusted Verilog simulator for compiling HDL code and executing testbenches to verify design functionality.
* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y iverilog
    ```
* **Verification Snapshot:**
    `iverilog -V`
   

#### 3. GTKWave - Waveform Analyzer

* **Function:** An indispensable tool for graphically viewing and debugging digital waveforms (VCD files) produced during simulation.
* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y gtkwave
    ```
* **Verification Snapshot:**
    `gtkwave --version`
